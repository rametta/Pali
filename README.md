Pali is a 3D multiplayer Godot trade card game (TCG).

This repository holds everything needed to export and run a personal dedicated server for the game, and game clients. The code can be used as a base for your own card game.

## Rules for the game

- Goal of the game is to build a hand of 5 cards that exceeds the points of your opponents 5 cards in their hand.
- The game has 25 cards total and starts by dealing 5 cards randomly to each player.
- It is turn based, every turn, you can either:
  1. Place a card from your hand onto the table
  2. or switch a card from the table with one in your hand.
- When there are no more cards in the deck, the game is over and points are tallied to determine the winner.
- There is no time limit

### Point counting

- Every card has a point value near the top to represent their base points
- Every card also has a "category", in this example it is "Engineer" for the Aerospace Engineer card. **For every other card in your hand that is also an engineer, you get another +2 points added to your hand.**
- Some cards may optionally have some "tags". In this example, the Aerospace engineer card has 2 tags, "Nature" and "White Coat". **For every other card in your hand that has any of the same tags, you get an additonal +1 point added to your hand per tag.**
- Finally, cards have a special relationship with 1 or 2 other cards in the game that are in different categories. For this example, the Aerospace Engineer gets a +6 point boost if you also have the "Psychologist" card in your hand.

Points are automatically calculated and shown in the bottom right/left sides of the screen.

### Controls

There are minimal controls:

- Left mouse clicking - click to select card in hand, then click empty space on table to place card, or, click another card on table to show a popup to confirm a switch
- Z - to zoom into the table and get a better top-down view to read the cards on the table

## How to export dedicated server

The game is not peer-to-peer, but relies on a dedicated server, every server can handle only 2 peer connections, once 2 peers are connected - the game begins.

If you have a server IP address, place it in [Global.gd](./Global.gd) as the `SERVER_ADDRESS`, then export the dedicated server and client using the presets already available.
